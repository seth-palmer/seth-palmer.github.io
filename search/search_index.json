I also enjoy programming and have worked on projects ranging from android apps to Websites. I enjoy mixing my other hobby of music with programming and creating music related apps. Languages I've coded in Coding Scripting Skills and Experience Bubble Brawl I was part of a game jam in 2025 my team and I made a local multiplayer game in 48 hours! I worked on the menu interface for the game and collaborated closely with our composer to integrate our music into the game. The main challenge I had to overcome was learning a new language (GD Script). I really enjoyed working out how to make music dynamic with the game and I plan to work on more games in the future. Hippotherapy App As part of my schooling we worked with a real industry contact on a seven month project. I was part of a group with six other developers. I worked on a range of features from a graphical data analysis to securing the app with logins. Our app also had an extensive suite of tests to ensure the functionality is maintained between releases. I learned a lot about working with a team of developers and proper ways to test functionality. One thing I would change would be spending more time researching the technologies to use for the app, as some of what we picked later ended up making some features impossible.
