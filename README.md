I'm Seth, I like working with computer hardware and coding software. I often repurpose older computers that might otherwise go unused. I am fascinated by digital security and like to read up on current security related news.

I also enjoy programming and have worked on projects ranging from android apps to Websites. I enjoy mixing my other hobby of music with programing and creating music related apps.
