## Experience

### [Bubble Brawl](https://ltngkarbn.itch.io/bubble-brawl)
I was part of a game jam in 2025 my team and I made a local multiplayer game in 48 hours! 

I worked on the menu interface for the game and collaborated closely with our composer to integrate our music into the game.  The main challenge I had to overcome was learning a new language (GD Script). I really enjoyed working out how to make music dynamic with the game and I plan to work on more games in the future.

### Hippotherapy App
As part of my schooling we worked with a real industry contact on a seven month project. I was part of a group with six other developers. I worked on a range of features from a graphical data analysis to securing the app with logins. Our app also had an extensive suite of tests to ensure the functionality is maintained between releases.

I learned a lot about working with a team of developers and proper ways to test functionality. One thing I would change would be spending more time researching the technologies to use for the app, as some of what we picked later ended up making some features impossible.

### Web Projects 

For a a web development class we coded websites that used both established and more recent web technologies. The projects were done in pairs and allowed us to practice working closely with a single team member. I coded two major  projects with [Douglas Riese](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/douglas-riese-51959413b), a project where all the processing is done on the web server named "Card Addicts", and a more modern component based programming model.
